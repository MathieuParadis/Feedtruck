## Description :
Feedtruck is an application that connects individuals with foodtrucks around their homes in Paris.
The project is in line with the trend that consumers are looking to have their meals brought to them rather than travelling to different place, and differs from existing solutions on the market by proposing not to bring a delivery person to the consumer but the whole restaurant.

It allows to develop a close relationship with the restaurant owners and to develop a loyal clientele fonds of local businesses. It also makes it possible to dispense with delivery personnel, who are often exploited in the face of social law in competing concepts.
